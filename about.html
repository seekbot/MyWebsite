            <p>Hi, thank you for visiting my website.
            <br><br>
            My name is Ji Jeong, and I am a student in the Simon Fraser University (SFU) Faculty of Applied Science program, located at British Columbia, Canada.
            My specialization is in mechatronics systems engineering.
            <br><br>
            I am also a member of SFU's Robot Soccer club and learn different aspects of engineering, 
            including mechanical, electrical/electronics and software. I am fortunate enough to be a member of this club 
            and learn robotics in-depth with my teammates, outside of the classroom.
            <br><br>
